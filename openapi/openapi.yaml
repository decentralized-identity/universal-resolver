      summary: Resolve a DID / Dereference a DID URL
      description: <p>This endpoint resolves a DID. As input it takes the DID, plus
        DID resolution <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-resolution-options">options</a>.
        The output is a DID document in one of the supported representations, plus
        metadata. The same endpoint can also be used to dereference a DID URL. In
        this case, the output is a DID document, or part of a DID document, or some
        other resource identified by the DID URL.</p> <p>See the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">DID
